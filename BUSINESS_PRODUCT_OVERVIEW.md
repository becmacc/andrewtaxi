### 16.3 Strategic Vision

Andrew's Taxi is positioned to become the leading digital taxi platform in Lebanon, with potential for regional expansion. The combination of lightweight technology, local expertise, and customer-centric design creates a defensible moat against both traditional competitors and potential international entrants.

**Long-Term Vision:**
Transform Andrew's Taxi from a single-city operation into a regional transportation network, leveraging Lebanon as a proof-of-concept for similar emerging markets where app-based solutions face adoption challenges. The ultimate goal is to become the preferred technology platform for small-to-medium taxi operators across the Middle East and North Africa region.
